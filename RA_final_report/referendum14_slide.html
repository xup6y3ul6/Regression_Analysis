# 同性戀態度

### 負面 / 恐同可能因素
- 年齡較大、男性 &gt; 女性、較少接觸到高等教育、鄉下或小城鎮&lt;br /&gt;  .cite[(Herk, 1984)]
- 結過婚的 .cite[(Seltzer, 1992)]
- 家中成員多 .cite[(Adamczyk &amp; Pitt, 2009)]
- 收入較低者 .cite[(West &amp; Cowell, 2013)]
- 大學教育以上的中年人比起老年人與年輕人較有正面態度&lt;br /&gt; .cite[(Seltzer, 1992)]
- 青少年與大學年齡的男性比中年人更可能持強烈的否定立場&lt;br /&gt; .cite[(王晴峰, 2013)]

--

### 並非所有研究都相同
- 年齡大者反而負面態度較小 .cite[(West &amp; Cowell,2013)]
- 性別差異不顯著 .cite[(Bowman, 1979; Glenn &amp; Weaver,1979)]
- 與收入高低無關 .cite[(Gelbal &amp; Duyan 2006; Becker &amp; Scheufele, 2009)]

---

# 同性戀態度

### 其他可能因子  
- 對 79 國的同性戀態度進行多元迴歸分析，其中包含:宗較、年紀、家中小孩人數、有無結婚、收入、教育狀態...等都有顯著影響。其中特別是.tomato[宗教信仰]最能影響同性戀態度的取向 .cite[(Jäckle &amp; Wenzelburger, 2015)]

- 透過後設分析，將主要影響各國同性戀態度的原因歸類至.tomato[經濟、民主、宗教]三個主要因子 .cite[(Adamczyk &amp; Liao, 2019)]

--

總結來說，可能的影響因子：  
- __年齡、性別、區域(都市/鄉下)、婚姻狀況、教育程度、經濟收入、種族、民主、宗教__...等
- 以及變項間的交互作用
- 雖然有許多變項會影響同性戀態度，但受限於資料的取得 (如：台灣並無宗教信仰普查)，故期望後續研究得以加入。

# Binomial regression model


Let 

- `\(\bar{y_i}\)` be the observed agree_rate in the `\(i\)`th 鄉鎮市區
- `\(N_i\)` be the number of the valid vote in the `\(i\)`th 鄉鎮市區
- `\(\pi_i\)` be the probability of agree.

--

Our preliminary model is

$$
`\begin{align}
N_i\bar{y}_i \sim Binomial(N_i, \pi_i) \\
\pi_i = g^{-1}(\eta_i) = g^{-1}(\boldsymbol{x_i^\top\beta})
\end{align}`
$$

where `\(i = 1, \dots, 368\)`,  `\(\boldsymbol{x_i} = (x_{i1}, ..., x_{i7})\)` and `\(g(\cdot)\)` is a link function.

# Model selection

考慮原始.blue[兩兩變項間之交互作用項]加入於原始模型中，但不考慮高次項

--

.blue[R 原生套件中的函式 `step()`] 來執行逐步迴歸 .cite[(R Core Team, 2020)]

- AIC、BIC 兩種準則
- 前向、反向、雙向選擇

找出六個候選模型 (有可能會找出相同模型)，但其缺點在於它並不會搜尋完所有的子模型

--

.blue[glmulti 套件的函式 `glmulti()`] 來搜尋前幾佳的 GLM .cite[(Calcagno, 2020)]
- AIC、BIC 兩種準則

再找出六個候選模型

---

# Model selection

&lt;img src="figures/glm_candidate_model.png" width="80%" style="display: block; margin: auto;" /&gt;

選擇基準：

- AIC、BIC、MSPE (LOOCV) 較小者
- 若兩變項之交互作用存在時其相對應的主要效果也應在模型之中

偏好 **M2** 作為暫時的最佳模型

---

# 兩難

1. 如果我不用 quasi-binomial regression 去擬合的話，M2 還是會有很大的過度離散現象存在

2. 如果我選擇用 quasi likelihood 的做法，我便沒法使用 AIC、BIC 來做模型的選擇 &lt;br /&gt;
.gray[(但似乎可以用 QAIC)]

我後來想到我既然都是使用 identity function 作為鏈結函數的選擇，.tomato[那何不直接使用一般線性模型 (general linear model) 來估計同意率 (𝜋) 呢？]

# AIC (likelihood) 怪怪的？

使用 weighted least square estimation 在 general linear regression 下的 AIC 為 .tomato[-1571.9]

但先前用 binomial regression (with identity link) 下的 AIC 大多為 .blue[18XXX] 以上

--

原因在於
- 前者的 likelihood 計算上是用 .tomato[normal distribution] 

$$
l(\boldsymbol{\beta}, \sigma) = \sum\ln\left((2\pi\sigma^2 )^{-\frac{1}{2}}exp(\frac{\bar{y}_i-\hat{\pi}_i(\boldsymbol{\beta})}{2\sigma^2})\right)
$$

- 而後者則是用 .blue[binomial distribution]

$$
l((\boldsymbol{\beta}) = \sum \ln\left( {N_i \choose N_i\bar{y_i}} [\hat{\pi}_i(\boldsymbol{\beta})]^{N_i\bar{y_i}} [1-\hat{\pi}_i(\boldsymbol{\beta})]^{N_i(1-\bar{y_i})}\right) 
$$

- 前向、反向、雙向選擇

找出六個候選模型

--

.blue[leaps 套件的函式 `regsubsets()`] 來搜尋模型候選 .cite[(Lumley, 2020)]

在主要效果的部分：

1. **投票率**、**性別比**、**年齡中位數**、**結婚率**或是**大學教育程度**越高，.tomato[同意率會越低]；
2. 在**直轄市**或是**離島**的地區，以及**薪水中位數**越高，.blue[同意率會越高]

但考量他變項之間的交互作用項的影響：

1. **性別比與大學教育程度**、**年齡與結婚率**、**結婚率與大學教育程度**這三者的交互作用項較效果越高，則.blue[同意率越高]；
2. **年齡中位數與薪水**交互作用項越高，則.tomato[同意率越低]。

依照年齡拆成三組與同意率做散佈圖

- 年輕人 (18~30) 負相關 (r = -0.14)
- 中年人 (31-65) 正相關 (r = 0.21)
- 老年人 (65-) 無相關 (r = -0.04)

.pull-right[
- 過往文獻中年齡對於同性戀的態度也尚未有定論，且會與其他因素交雜在一起

- 我們都以為年紀較長者不容易接受婚姻平權，因此比較容易投不同意票。依據這次的模型結果，年齡中位數越高的地區
同意率較低 (當然還要考慮交互作用項，因此關係沒那麼簡單)

- 但如果我們沒有考量其他變項的因素，或者是換不同種的年齡變項的計算方式，結果有可能會大不相同

# 研究限制與改進方向

- 公投14案：同性婚姻納入民法 ≠ 同性戀態度

- 鄉鎮市區為每筆資料單位，但真的有代表性嗎


- 無法得之確切的投票人行為和態度


- 缺少一些可能的潛在變項 (宗教、家庭人數等)


- 離島 (界外值) 特別性質


- 假若我們有每個投票者的個人資料與行為，或許以後可以考慮使用 hierarchical linear model
